1.Simulate Cloud Storage:
Create a directory structure on your local machine to simulate cloud storage. Place sample files in these directories to represent your sensitive data.

2.Simulate Database:
Use a simple SQLite database to store metadata about your sensitive data. You can create tables to store information such as file names, paths, and access logs.

3.Implement Logging:
Write functions or use Python logging to simulate logging. For example, log when a file is accessed, modified, or deleted.

4.Define Data Leak Patterns:
Identify patterns or rules that might indicate a data leak. This could include specific keywords, file types, or access patterns.

5.Implement Event Triggers:
Use Python functions or scripts to simulate event triggers. For instance, you can use file system monitoring libraries like watchdog to detect changes to files and trigger events.

6.Scan Data for Patterns:
Write Python scripts that scan the stored data for the defined leak patterns. Python libraries like os and re can be used to search for patterns within files.

7.Send Alerts:
Simulate sending alerts when a potential data leak is detected. This can be a simple print statement or writing to a log file.

8.Implement Access Controls:
Simulate access controls by using file permissions or database queries to limit who can access sensitive data.

9.Testing:
Test your system by creating scenarios that simulate both normal and potential leak situations. This can involve modifying files, accessing them, and observing how your system responds.

10.Documentation:
Document your simulated system, including the directory structure, database schema, and how each component of your system works together.
