Documentation

Directory Structure:

Create a file (directory_structure.txt or directory_structure.md) to describe the structure of your project directory. Include information about where different components and data files are located.
Example:

diff
Copy code
Project Directory Structure:

- data/
  - cloud_storage/
    - documents/
    - confidential/
  - database/
- logs/
- main.py
- data_leak_detection.py
- event_handler.py
- requirements.txt
Database Schema:

Create a file (database_schema.txt or database_schema.md) to outline the schema of your SQLite database. Include details about the tables, fields, and their relationships.
Example:

sql
Copy code
Database Schema:

Table: file_metadata
- id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
- file_path (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- access_count (INTEGER, DEFAULT 0)
Component Functionality:

Create a file (component_functionality.txt or component_functionality.md) to describe the functionality of major components in your project, such as data_leak_detection.py and event_handler.py.
Example:

markdown
Copy code
Component Functionality:

- data_leak_detection.py:
  - Implements data leak detection mechanisms.
  - Logs events and access counts.
  - Scans files for potential data leak patterns.

- event_handler.py:
  - Implements file system event handling using watchdog.
  - Monitors changes in the cloud storage directory.
Project Overview:

Create a file (project_overview.txt or project_overview.md) to provide an overview of your project. Include information about the purpose, key features, and any considerations for future development.
Example:

sql
Copy code
Project Overview:

This project simulates a data leak detection system using cloud storage. It includes components for monitoring file system events, logging access and modification events, scanning for potential data leak patterns, and implementing access controls.
10.2 Include Information About Dependencies
Update your requirements.txt file to include information about the Python libraries your project depends on. This is crucial for setting up the environment with the necessary dependencies.

Example requirements.txt:

makefile
Copy code
watchdog==2.1.3
10.3 Store Documentation Files in the Project Directory
Place the documentation files in the root directory of your project for easy access and reference.

10.4 Keep Documentation Updated
As your project evolves, make sure to update the documentation files to reflect any changes in the structure, functionality, or dependencies.
